Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automata simulation that follows simple rules to create interesting patterns. It was invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970 and popularized by Martin Gardner’s “Mathematical Games” column in Scientific American.
Today, it’s a favorite among programmers and computer scientists, though it’s more an interesting visualization than a true “game”.
The two dimensional board has a grid of “cells,” each of which follows three simple rules:
• Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the simulation.
• Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of the simulation.
• Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation.
The living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simulation depends entirely on their current state. The cells don’t “remember” any older states.
