The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1 problem, is the simplest impossible math
problem.
From a starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next number in the sequence:
1. If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
2. If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.
